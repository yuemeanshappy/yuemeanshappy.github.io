*How are morphological traits formed and maintained? How do they evolve over time? Why do they evolve in this way?*

## Genetic basis of convergent floral trait evolution in *Pedicularis*
If you have seen flowers of *Pediculairs*, you will probably be surprised by their super diverse floral colors and complicated floral shapes. Purple, magenta, yellow and white and various combinations of these colors are the color palette of *Pedicularis*'s flowers. Flowers have five petals and the base of the petals fuse together (and elongate) into a corolla tube. The length of the corolla tube can vary extensively from <1 cm to >15 cm. The upper two petals also fuse together into a hood-like structure termed the galea. In many species this structure has become elongated into a tube-like structure called the beak, which is highly variable among species in length and curvature. Both galea, beak and corolla tube length variations are associated with mating success, through their effects on the palcement and pickup of pollen from bublebee pollinators, or pollen-tube competition in the style. Variations among species may play a role in reducing interspecific pollination and hybridization.

These floral traits have convergent evolutionary patterns, but little is known about the potential genetic mechanisms. Do they share similar genetic pathways? How do they evolve over time? Are the evolutionary patterns related with the pollinator selection?

To answer these questions, we use photogrammetry to build 3D models of *Pediculairs*'s flowers and extract morphological traits from these 3D models. Based on the transcriptome data, we aim to figure out the potential genetic mechanisms behind floral trait evolution, such as the presence/absence of genes or the up-regulated/down-regulated gene expression levels.
