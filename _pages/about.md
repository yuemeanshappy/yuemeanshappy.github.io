Hello! Welcome to my website!

I am Yue, a PhD student in the [Eaton Lab](https://eaton-lab.org/) in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology program at [Columbia University](https://e3b.columbia.edu/). Here you can find my past and current research projects, some interesting posts and nice photos (I hope!) and my CV.

Always being amazed at the diversity of plant morphological traits, I am curious about the evolutionary story behind them. I am interested in intergrating different perspectives from genetic basis, environmental factors and species interactions to reveal a whole picture of morphological trait diversification. I am also interested in implementing algorithms into codes and exploring new methodologies related with trait evolution.

In my spare time, I like being in the nature, exploring different types of food, and of course traveling.
