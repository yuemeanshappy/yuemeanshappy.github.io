Hello! Welcome to my website!

My main research interests are about plant diversity and computational tool development. I am interested in figuring out the potential causes and consequences of plant morphological trait diversity by intergrating genetic factors, environmental conditions and species interactions. Meanwhile, I believe the progress of evolutionary studies would be slow-moving without methodological advancements. Therefore, I am interested in developing computational tools to help us better analyze genomes and trait data.

I am currently a master student in the [Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology program at Columbia University](https://e3b.columbia.edu/) and I work with [Dr. Deren Eaton](https://eaton-lab.org/). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in [horticulture at Zhejiang University](http://www.cab.zju.edu.cn/yyxenglish/) and went to University of California, Davis as an exchange student in my third year of university.
