Hello! Welcome to my website!

I am Yue, a PhD student in the [Eaton Lab](https://eaton-lab.org/) in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology program at [Columbia University](https://e3b.columbia.edu/). Here you can find not only my past and current research projects as a researcher, but also some interesting posts and nice photos (I hope!).

Always being amazed at the diversity of plant morphological traits, I am curious about the evolutionary story behind them. How do they evolve over time? What might be the potential causes? I aim at intergrating different perspectives from genetic basis, environmental factors and species interactions to help us reveal a whole picture of morphological trait diversification. I am also interested in implement algorithms into codes and exploring new methodologies related with trait evolution. I believe the advancement of evolution might be slower without methodological improvement.
